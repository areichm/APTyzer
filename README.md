# APT_analyzer
A jupyter note based tool to view and analyze atom probe tomography (APT) tips.

By providing a .pos or .epos file as well as a .rrng file the user can visualize the APT-tip and customize the visualization. Furthermore the user can set controlpoints inside the tip to locate and mark areas of interest, such as mark the location of a grain boundary (GB). These controlpoints can then be printed out into a .hdf5 file. The concentration profile of all atoms or each individual atom type can be plotted along a cylinder which can be placed and tilted by the user. From the concentration, the excess can also be plotted. Both excess and concentration profile can be printed out as .csv files.
